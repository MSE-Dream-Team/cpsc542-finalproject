# CPSC 542 - Software Verfication and Validation

This is the fullstack app for the [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). 🚀

## File structure

The app is in the main folder:
- `main`: Final version

From within `main` directory, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```

To run tests, run these commands:

```bash
npm run test
```

```bash
npm run test -- --coverage
```
